üåç[From risk assessment to land planning. The case of a trace element contaminated area in Chile]

Authors: Andr√©s Salazar (GeoStyle) and Pedro Mondaca

Here we featured the Google Earth Engine (GEE) & R Script associated with the scientific paper titled 
"From risk assessment to land planning. The case of a trace element contaminated area in Chile"
submitted to Land Degradation & Development.

In this research we developed two user-friendly APPs to see the current and the future land use suitability.
Such suitability was constrained by soil As concentration and for the emerging risks. 
APP1: Current suitability

APP2: Modeled suitability based on the projected As aerial emissions from the Industrial Complex.

- GEE script

This script output the land use suitability of three land uses categories based on soil arsenic contamination
and the hazards associated with potential emerging risks (explosions or fires).

The script is available at https://code.earthengine.google.com/45ea2872fcf691e91b736fab049859c4?noload=true


- R script 

https://github.com/pemori/S-DSS/Land_use_modeling.R

It models soil As contamination under different aerial emission loads. Specifically, the code models how land
suitability change based on current and alternative scenarios. Moreover, it measures the surface that have changed 
among the categories.
