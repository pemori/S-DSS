üåç[From risk assessment to land planning. The case of a trace element contaminated area in Chile]

Here we shared the Google Earth Engine (GEE) & R Script associated with the scientific paper titled 
"From risk assessment to land planning. The case of a trace element contaminated area in Chile"
submitted to Land Degradation & Development.

GEE script

Available at https://code.earthengine.google.com/45ea2872fcf691e91b736fab049859c4?noload=true

That script output tha land use suitability of three land uses categories based on soil arsenic contamination
and the hazards associated with potential emerging risks (explosions or fires).

R script 

Model soil As contamination under different aerial emission loads. The code model how land suitability change
based on current and alternative scenarios. Moreover, it measures the surface that have changed among the categories.
